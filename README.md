# React.js: Home Page

## Description
In this task, you will create a **Home Page** for your e-commerce React application. The application will represent your chosen product or entity from previous assignments (3-5). The Home Page should serve as the foundation of your app, adhering to the provided wireframe layout.

## Requirements

### General Requirements
1. **React.js Library**: 
   - All markup must be created using React.js. 
   - The `index.html` file in the `public` folder should remain untouched.
   
2. **Project Setup**:
   - Use the `create-react-app` tool to initialize your project.
   - [Get started with create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

3. **Wireframe Compliance**:
   - Your Home Page must include all elements outlined in the wireframe (header, navigation, footer, etc.).

4. **Design**:
   - Apply CSS styling or use component libraries for UI. Minimal or no styling is **not acceptable**.
   - Use your creativity for the visual design.

5. **Functionality**:
   - For this phase, only the **view** part is required.
   - Interactive elements (links, buttons) are not necessary but will be implemented in future tasks.

### Code Style
1. **Project Structure**:
   - Divide your UI into logical React components, with each component in its own file.
   - A minimum of **five component files** is required.
   
2. **Component Type**:
   - Use **Functional Components** instead of Class Components.
   - Learn more about Functional Components and props [here](https://uk.reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html).

## Example Workflow
1. **Setup**:
   - Run `npx create-react-app my-app` to scaffold your React project.
2. **Structure**:
   - Create React components for each section of the page (e.g., Header, Footer, Navigation, MainContent, etc.).
3. **Styling**:
   - Apply CSS or a library like TailwindCSS, Bootstrap, or Material-UI for styling.
4. **Development**:
   - Implement the view structure based on the wireframe.
5. **Testing**:
   - Ensure all components render properly and follow the wireframe design.

## Notes
- Follow the wireframe closely while adding your creative touches to the design.
- Use reusable and modular components to improve code maintainability.
- Keep code organized and clean for future scalability.
