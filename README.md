# CRUD JavaScript App: View Page

## Description
This project involves creating a simple **View Page** for a website. The page should showcase data and provide basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. You can use data from your previous Java/Python project class. If you do not have data from a previous project, select any free task from [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RW9PpalOlHn-nVIi8kbCr71vu_XLNsjj4TKpTdBnZ-w/edit?usp=sharing).

The **View Page** wireframe template can be found [here](https://wireframepro.mockflow.com/view/lviv-iot-crud-js-app).

## Functionalities to Implement
Using JavaScript, implement the following operations on your dataset (you decide which field to use for each operation):

1. **Sort Items**: Allow users to sort the data by a selected field.
2. **Search**: Enable searching for specific items based on a field.
3. **Calculate Totals**: Provide the total sum of a particular numeric field (e.g., total price of all cars).

## Requirements
- **Responsiveness**: Not required.
- **Styling**: Optional and up to you.
- **Core Functionalities**: 
  - Sorting
  - Searching
  - Calculating total amounts

## Recommendations and Tips
- Use JavaScript **Array methods**:
  - `map()`
  - `sort()`
  - `filter()`
  - `reduce()`
- Use **native JavaScript** for all DOM operations:
  - `querySelector`
  - `getElementById`
  - `insertAdjacentHTML`, etc.
- Refer to examples of DOM manipulation and working with JavaScript arrays from:
  - [Vanilla Web Projects](https://github.com/bradtraversy/vanillawebprojects/tree/master/dom-array-methods)

## Example Resources
- Live coding examples and similar projects are provided in the [useful projects section](https://github.com/bradtraversy/vanillawebprojects/tree/master/dom-array-methods).
