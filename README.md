# CRUD JavaScript App: Backend

## Description
In this final part of the project, you will implement all **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** (CRUD) operations via the corresponding HTTP methods in your **REST API**. These operations will enable dynamic interaction between your frontend and backend.

### Key Points:
- **Reusing Existing Backend**: If you have a backend server from previous work (e.g., from your first year), integrate it with your frontend.
- **Creating a New Backend**: If no backend is available, create a new REST API using any technology you are comfortable with.

## Requirements
- Implement all CRUD operations:
  - **Create**: Use `POST` to add new items.
  - **Read**: Use `GET` to retrieve data.
  - **Update**: Use `PUT` or `PATCH` to modify existing items.
  - **Delete**: Use `DELETE` to remove items.

- Use the `fetch()` API in JavaScript to interact with your backend.

## Recommendations and Tips
- Use the following resources to guide your implementation:
  - [Working with REST API using fetch()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)
  - Live coding examples for integrating frontend with a backend.

## Notes
- Ensure your REST API follows standard HTTP methods and conventions.
- Properly handle errors and provide feedback to users when operations fail.
- Validate input data on both the frontend and backend.
